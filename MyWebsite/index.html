                <p>My name is Sierra Sandoval, I am a sophomore attending Colorado State University. I am majoring in Media Communications and minoring in Art, I am also enrolled in an overload semester right now-Spring 2021 semester. I hope to graduate a year early, 2022 and after graduating, I plan to move to Arizona to continue in a career I love. I enjoy traveling and going to concerts with my friends. I have two sisters and currently live with my mom, taking care of her. I also work at Sonic as a carhop here in Pueblo. </p>
